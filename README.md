# Design_and_Analysis_of_Algorithm
This course will cover basic concepts in the design and analysis of algorithms. Asymptotic complexity, O() notation. Sorting and search. Algorithms on graphs: exploration, connectivity, shortest paths, directed acyclic graphs, spanning trees. Design techniques: divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming.Introduction to fundamental techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms, including asymptotic analysis; divide-and-conquer algorithms and recurrences; greedy algorithms; data structures; dynamic programming; graph algorithms; and randomized algorithms.
